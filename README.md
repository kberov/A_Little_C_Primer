A_Little_C_Primer
=================

Examples from "A Little C Primer" book.
The book can be found at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_Little_C_Primer.

It is an interesting feeling to read the book as if you never knew 
anything about programming, write the exmaple programs letter by letter
using a simple text editor, compile and run them. 
What a simple and relaxing fun :)!

As a side effect, at the end of the book I will know a lot more about programing 
and may even be able to write programs using the most powerfull language.
